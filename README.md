# Welcome to my Random Projects

These are just some random projects I have made while learning to code in C# and others. It helps me apply what I have learned and get better. You will probably see a gradual change as my code gets better and better as I progress through the learning process. 

Feel free to look at these projects and let me know if there is anything that I could implement better and so on. 
All of these files are safe. You can find specifications for each project depending on what folders its inside of.
